        <p> This should be the first paragragh</p>
        <p> And this won't be the last</p>
        <p> What if I don't want spaces bewteen two paragraghs? 
            Can I get rid of it?</p>
        <p> Seems that I can get <big><big>one</big></big> <br /> But how to delete it? 
            ps: In fact, they got some thing different</p>

        <p> It can "create a line-break 
            without an extra space between the text blocks"</p>
        <p> <ins>Wow, look up!
        <b>"big"</b> can be used multiple times!</ins></p>

            Browsers display
            strong as b , and em  as i . 
            However, the meanings of these tags differ: b  and i  
            define bold and italic text, respectively, while strong  
            and em  indicate that the text is "important".
